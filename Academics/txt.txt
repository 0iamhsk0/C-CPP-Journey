To write a code using classes, firstly class is created using keyword class as class can have data member and member function as these both are declared inside the class.
A class can have Access specifier public,private or even protected.
The members which are private can not be accessed outside the class but the member which are public they can be accessed outside the class.

1. enum
2. static variable 
3. constant variable
4. static member of a class
5. constant member of a class

Static variable is not reinitilized every time

A class can also use static data members

A reference variable means a new name for existing variable. No need of the dereference variable here.

use of pointer for classes in c++  :-
1. inside the class -> as pointer data of class.
2. pointer of object -> object of class is of pointer type.

To access members of a class when 
pointers are used for object as well as on class members then we use pointer to member operators which are  ->* .* (dereferencing operator)
1. ->* this is used to access members of class, .* is used when object of class itself is used  with the member pointer.
2. A class member pointer can be declared using ::* it means if class is A then A::* means pointer to members.
3.Suppose class A has a data member n then &A::n it means address of n data member of A class.  

the this pointer:
    holds the address of current obj;
    each object of class has the access of its own class, which is possible with this pointer
    this pointer is used to call functions and variables of same class.
    this pointer is implicitily available to all the memer func of a class
    it points to the current address of the pointer which is being stated
